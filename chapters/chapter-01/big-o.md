## Big O Notation

#### Chapter One - B.O.N. Notes

* Big O Notation describes how fast an algorithm is.  
<br>
* Format: **O(N)** → *Big O + number of operations (length)*  
<br>
* Examples:  
    - **O(log N)** → binary search  
    - **O(N)** → simple search  
    - **O(N log N)** → quicksort  
    - **O(N²)** → selection sort  
    - **O(N!)** → traveling salesman problem  
<br>
* In these examples, the execution time increases from top to bottom.  
<br>
* How fast an algorithm is isn’t measured in seconds, but by how the number of operations grows — in other words, how the runtime increases as the input size grows.
